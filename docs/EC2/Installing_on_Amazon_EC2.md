## Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Setup

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains a software
configuration (for example, an operating system, an application server,
and applications e.g Core). From an AMI, one launches an instance, which
is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server in the cloud. One can
launch multiple instances of an AMI. Instances keep running until one
stops or terminates them, or until they fail. If an instance fails, one
can launch a new one from the AMI.

## Relational Database Setup

To get a managed relational database in the cloud, here we use Amazon
Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) to launch a database instance.
Although you can set up a database on an EC2 instance, Amazon RDS offers
the advantage of handling your database management tasks, such as
patching the software, backing up, and storing the backups.
